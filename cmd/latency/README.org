* Raft Consensus with Gorums

** Latency

=latency= measures a clusters commit latency.
The leader of the cluster is found before the measuring starts.
Failover to a new leader is implemented so that we can see how it affects latency.

*** Usage
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Usage of latency:
  -add value
    	Remote server address, repeat argument for each server in the cluster
  -clients int
    	Number of clients (default 15)
  -output string
    	What to use as the base for the output filenames (default "client.txt")
  -rate int
    	How many requests each client sends per second (default 15)
  -time int
    	How long to measure in seconds (default 30)
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Example
After a cluster is started execute the following command and wait =time= seconds for the output.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
latency -add :9201 -add :9202 -add :9203
#+END_SRC

*** HdrHistogram Plotter
The generated files can be used with [[http://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/plotFiles.html][HdrHistogram Plotter]] to create a latency by percentile distribution plot.
